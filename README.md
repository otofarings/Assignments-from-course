# Assignments_from_course
Here are the assignments from IBM Data Science course.
## [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science)
1. [Analyzing US Economic Data and Building a Dashboard](https://github.com/otofarings/Assignments_from_courses/blob/main/Analyzing%20US%20Economic%20Data.ipynb)
  - From course [Python for Data Science and AI](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai/home/info)
  - In this assignment, I extracted some essential economic indicators from some data, then displayed these economic indicators in a Dashboard. I marked on my ability to apply Python programming concepts that would commonly be used to load,  analyze and share data.
  
2. [SQL Data Science Assignment](https://github.com/otofarings/Assignments_from_courses/blob/main/Assignment%20SQL%20Course%20.ipynb)
  - From course [Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science/home/info)
  - In this assignment, I worked with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. I created a database instance in the cloud. I practiced building and running SQL queries. I also learned how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.

3. [Analyzing House Sales in King County, USA](https://github.com/otofarings/Assignments_from_courses/blob/main/House%20Sales%20in%20King%20County%2C%20USA.ipynb)
  - From course [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/home/info)
  - In this assignment, I analyzed and predicted housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. I used Watson Studio to perform the analysis.

4. [Visualizing US Domestic Airline Flights Performance](https://github.com/otofarings/Assignments_from_courses/blob/main/US%20Domestic%20Airline%20Flights%20Performance.ipynb)
  - From course [Data Visualization with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-data-visualization/home/info)
  - In this assignment, I demonstrated the data visualization skills I learned by completing course. Dashboard is based on the concept of demonstrating US Domestic Airline Flights Performance for a given year ( 2005 to 2020).

5. [Classification with Python](https://github.com/otofarings/Assignments-from-course/blob/preload/Classification%20with%20Python.ipynb)
  - From course [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/home/info)
  - In this assignment, I built a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. I loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithm on the data.
